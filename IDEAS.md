# Ideas

A living document of ideas for the presentation.

## Presentation Concepts

- Context engineering as a core theme — how you structure information for AI agents determines their output quality
- Living files convention (AGENTS.md, IDEAS.md) — files that AI agents read and update, creating a shared context layer
- Meta-presentation: the presentation itself was built using the workflow it describes (voice → Wispr Flow → AI agent → code)
- Call out obsolete developer workflows — manual ticket management, solo coding, copy-paste from Stack Overflow
- Demonstrate the new paradigm: voice coding, AI orchestration, context engineering

## Technical Demos

- Gustavo as the primary subject — AI agent orchestrator CLI
- Pinball Monte Carlo simulation as proof that AI independently arrives at creative solutions
- Embed the pinball game as a live interactive slide
- Show gustavo init → task creation → orchestration flow live

## Comic Relief ("Ask Dave")

- Second laptop in audience speaks using macOS `say` command via SSH
- Dave (friend/skeptic) unknowingly holds the laptop during the talk
- Triggered at key moments: after pro-AI claims, Dave's laptop delivers self-deprecating zingers
- Keep humor PG, friendly roasting, loving ribbing between friends
- Potential voices: Fred, Zarvox, Ralph (classic Mac text-to-speech)

## Visual / Aesthetic

- Full cyberpunk 2077 aesthetic — dark backgrounds, neon accents, monospace fonts
- Presenter going full mohawk for the occasion
- Glowing text effects, scanline overlays, terminal-style animations
- 16:9 optimized for projector, large text for back-of-room readability

## Stretch Goals

- AI listening in background and responding in real-time to room conversation
- Live code generation during the talk
- Audience participation via QR code linking to the pinball demo
- Sound effects on slide transitions

## Hardware Setup

- M1 Max MacBook connected to venue projector via HDMI (clamshell mode)
- Bluetooth keyboard for walking around
- 2018 MacBook as Dave's "voice" — positioned in audience
- Wispr Flow + USB mic for voice coding demo
- Run presentation locally via `node server.js` (not from GitHub Pages) for full Dave integration
